description: "The Book of Wonder is the seventh book and fifth original short story\
  \ collection of Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, considered a major influence\
  \ on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin and others.\
  \ It was first published in hardcover by William Heinemann in November, 1912, and\
  \ has been reprinted a number of times since. A 1918 edition from the Modern Library\
  \ was actually a combined edition with Time and the Gods.\nThe book collects fourteen\
  \ fantasy short stories by the author.\nLord Dunsany employed the talents of Sidney\
  \ Sime to illustrate his fantasy short story collections, but The Book of Wonder\
  \ is unique in that Sydney Sime drew the illustrations first, and Lord Dunsany wrote\
  \ the tales to incorporate them:\n\n'I found Mr Sime one day, in his strange house\
  \ at Worplesdon, complaining that editors did not offer him very suitable subjects\
  \ for illustration; so I said: \"Why not do any pictures you like, and I will write\
  \ stories explaining them, which may add a little to their mystery?\"'\n From Wikipedia\
